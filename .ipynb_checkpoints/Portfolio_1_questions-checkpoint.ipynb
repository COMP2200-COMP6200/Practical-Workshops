Details such as their profile, ID, gender, city of birth, product ratings (on a scale of 1-5), reviews, and the prices of the products they purchased are all included. Moreover, for each product rating, we have information about the product name, ID, price, and category, the rating score, the timestamp of the rating and review, and the average helpfulness of the rating given by others (on a scale of 1-5).\n",
